# Assignment 5
## Objectives

To gain experience writing functions and using recursion.

### Part 1

1. Write a program `three.c` that takes in 3 user-input integers and checks whether or not the 3 integers form a valid triangle (no one side is longer than the sum of the other 2 sides).  It should contain the following functions: 
    - `isTriangle()`, which determines whether the integers form a valid triangle
    - `triangleType()`, which determines whether the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal), isoceles (only 2 sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal) and prints a message as appropriate
    - `sanitizedInput()`, which ensures that the user-input integers are valid

2. Write a program `palindrome.c` using recursion to test if a word/phrase is a palindrome (something that reads the same if the letters are reversed, such as racecar).

### Part 2

In a text file `assignment5.txt`, answer the following questions:

1.  What do each of the following mean?  Include a description of the syntax or an example.
      - Passing by value:
      - Passing by reference:

2.  What is the function of the return statement in C?

3.  What is the purpose of writing functions?
